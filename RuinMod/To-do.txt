Trafik - Tentacrim, Overseer of The Crimson, He's basically just a massive red squid who's like leaking blood from every crevasse of his body he has huge, tartar stained teeth. he tries to like eat you and stuff He has a huge opening in his chest In phase two, long, decrepit arms emerge from the hole

Me - Add the lightning bow from bo3 (name of bow is Kreema’ahm la Ahmahm)

Cramm - So once you beat moon lord You can fight 3 clockwork bosses It’s basically mech bosses but post moon lord and steampunk It would be king slime, queen bee and brain of chuthulu or deerclops

Cramm - You should add a new biome The swamp 

Cramm - And you could fight a Frog boss That attacks with his tongue And it could send bubbles from the sky

Cramm - Gamer class weapon, It’s like Marion’s red hammer It deals 5 damage And can be thrown

Me - NEW BIOME COULD BE LEGO LAND BIOME

Me - thanos boss

Me - add pvz stuff

Cramm - Maybe you could add an alloy smelter That makes alloys  It’s a combination of metals Like iron and lead Or Platinum and gold You could combine effects Like you could make a crimtaine chlorophite metal That could be used to make an accessory Or armour That would combine the effects
